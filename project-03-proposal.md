## Proposal

Compared to the examples for narratives, I don't think my Idea would be that creative.
 I'm not really into video games and stuff like dungeons and dragons, so I would probably have to go off what I do know about. 
Maybe I can do something fun with anime concepts or make a different plot with set design ideas. 
I don't have a complete fleshed-out concept, but I have small ideas that can go somewhere. 
I can make worlds and quests based on the animes and theatre scenic designs that I have been inspired by.
