How does Murray's prediction compare to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabit while acting? 
Name and discuss the different layers of 'reality' both the actors and the viewers experience in the production.


For the Mandalorian, using a virtual set was better and more cost-effective than a green screen. 

A disadvantage of a green screen is that you would have to adjust the lighting, and "Spill" is another issue. 

With virtual reality, everything looks natural in the lighting. 

It is also cost-effective to have a virtual set to save money on going to a different site. 

It is beneficial for the actors because they don't have to wait till the production is done to see the landscape of their scenes. 

The scenes can adjust the actor's movement making it more hyperrealistic.
