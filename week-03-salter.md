# What contemporary tools (digital or physical) could be used to create art that could be considered a Gesamtkunstwerk?
To create a Gesamtkunstwerk means to create a "total work of art" in Wanger's definition, it is "to include all phases of art and in doing so to consume, to destroy each one, so to speak, in favor of the total purpose of them all."
 Many contemporary tools can be used to create this; Wagner's Bayreuth theater is a good example. 
Having the seat shape as a Greek amphitheater configuration helps enhance the acoustics and the experience for the audience. 
The use of gaslighting draws the audience's focus to the stage; the dimming of the lights helps communicate to the audience that the production has begun and when intermission starts and finishes. 
The moving sets and props help the audience become consumed in the performance. 
All these tools in the theatre come together to create a successful; performance for both the performer and audience.

# Is there an example in the Rhizome Anthology that could qualify?
I think there are a couple of examples of a Gesamtkunstwerk in the Rhizome Anthology. 
One example is Alex Galloway, Mark Tribe, and Martin Wattenberg's "StarryNight," made in 1999.
 It was created from the "online archive of Rhizome's email discussion list." 
These lists were the contemporary tools to create the artistic interface. 
Each archived email was a glowing point of light, and every time a corresponding message was opened, the light would grow brighter. 
These archived emails created a piece of art.
