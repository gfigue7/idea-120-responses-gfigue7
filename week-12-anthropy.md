Access to making games and hearing voices can significantly improve video games by creating diverse templates for people. 
People's stories are different, and their ambitions and perspectives can help create more games that represent that.
It can inspire educational games and games that walk through the life of a different person. 
In this way, it takes a break from the same thing people always sell.

Violent games or games with gun violence make up a majority of the games that I have seen. 
It is not like there is anything wrong with it. It is just that I find it repetitive.
Hearing more voices will open the door to more possibilities, in my opinion. 

Let's say we incorporate theatre into a game.
Theatre productions are worlds within themselves and already come with plots and characters.
Imagine being able to step into the Emerald City in the musical Wicked or to meet the king from The King and I. 
Combing video gaming with these theatre aspects would make new games interesting and attract the thespian community. 

"A game is the complete exploration of freedom within a restrictive environment."- Vineet Raj Kapoor. 
If this is the case, adding to gaming would only make more to explore. 
Creating an inclusive and entraining game requires more people from different communities.
