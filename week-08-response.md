Would the internet be more useful and egalitarian without these methods (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design), or is it useful to direct users because your message could otherwise be lost among the sea of online content?

I'm not sure because I can see both perspectives on having these ads and not. 
For me, It is really unnerving to get because I will click on one video, and suddenly I'm flooded with similar things.
I think, in a way, it can be useful but probably not egalitarian.

On the other hand, you see the content you agree with. 
In this way, it is useful for finding opportunities.
But on the other hand, you don't see things you disagree with, so it does not make it equal.
