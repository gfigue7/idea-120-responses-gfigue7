Would the internet be more useful and egalitarian without these methods (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design), or is it useful to direct users because your message could otherwise be lost among the sea of online content?

I'm not sure because I can see both perspectives on having these ads and not. 
For me, It is really unnerving to get because I will click on one video, and suddenly I'm flooded with similar things.
I have never heard of Ann Taylor store before I worked there but after I was flooded with Ads on it.
I talked to my friend about a product and suddenly it is every other youtube ad.
I think, in a way, it can be useful but probably not egalitarian.

On the other hand, you see the content you agree with. 
In this way, it is useful for finding opportunities.
I needed to learn spanish fast to go on a trip to Puerto Rico and then I found programs that helped.
But on the other hand, you don't see things you disagree with or don't need, so it does not make it equal.
