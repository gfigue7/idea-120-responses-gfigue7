Access to gaming and code keeps these games from stagnating and becoming repetitive.
Having an influx of new gamers acts as a way to create multiple outcomes and keep things interesting. 
Simple shifts in rules can change the dynamic of what the game is supposed to result in.
Games mimic challenges in life or work, like how Tetris can reflect urban planning and politics. 
Chess is a game of strategies and reading your opponent, and it shows a person's decision-making skills and how they can see forward. 

Games themselves can be stories and inspire people.
 Gaming is a way of escape and plays the same role as a theatre production or playing songs. 
Just like music and theatre is a world I absorb myself in, the same goes for my friends who play Dungeons and Dragons; they serve the same purpose. 

Having access to create the games is beneficial to both the player and the designer. 
Each is challenged to either get through the game or improve it to make it better for other players.
