The Image is a poster for the movie In The Heights written by Lin Manuel Miranda. 

The denoted message is the title In The Heights, and the informative text like when it says is in theaters and on HBOMAX.
 It shows the Geroge Washington bridge behind the brick wall is plastered with the faces of the characters. 

The connoted messages are both small details and more significant concepts. 
The title is lit up like the club scene in the movie. 
The charters in the poster are looking to the distance as if to chase their dreams which is a recurring theme in the film. 
The ladies in the swimsuits and fanning themselves show that the scene takes place in summer.
 The man and his Piagrua cart invoke nostalgia for the Latinx community, specifically Puerto Ricans. 
The names Hamilton and Crazy Rich Asians are highlighted to show that if people love these films and shows, they might take an interest in the movie. 
The text that says " The time has come" gives you a feeling the movie will be powerful.

Putting it together, we see the movie is a Latinx movie taking place in the summer.
