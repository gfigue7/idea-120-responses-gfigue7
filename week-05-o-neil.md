In this file give an example in about 3 paragraphs of a 'WMD' as O'Neil describes it.


In Weapons Of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Brien she warns of the dangers of algorithms models to make decisions in our society. 
We see this in the education system and how teachers are reflected based on scores.
in the text "If you compare the results of the tests, the scores should stay stable, or hopefully, jump up. 
But if her results sink, it's easy to calculate the gap between her performance and that of the successful students. 
4But how much of that gap is due to her teacher? 
It's hard to know, and Mathematica's models have only a few numbers to compare. "(intro)
You can't judge a child's personality based on an algorithm. 
I know many teachers who have problem students.
They teach to the best of their ability but they may fall short of the standard.


In the book it states "The concept of a safety school is now largely extinct, thanks in great part to the U.S. News ranking. 
As we saw in the example of TCU, it helps in the rankings to be selective.
If an admissions office is flooded with applications, it's a sign that something is going right there. It speaks to the college's reputation. 
And if a college can reject the vast majority of those candidates, it'll probably end up with a higher caliber of students. 
Like many of the proxies, this metric seems to make sense. It follows market movements." (chapter 3)


In the book nit states"But let's consider McDaniel's case in terms of fairness. He happened to grow up in a poor and dangerous neighborhood.
 In this, he was unlucky. He has been surrounded by crime, and many of his acquaintances have gotten caught up in it. 
 And largely because of these circumstances—and not his own actions—he has been deemed dangerous. 
Now the police have their eye on him. 
And if he behaves foolishly, as millions of other Americans do on a regular basis, 
if he buys drugs or gets into a barroom fight or carries an unregistered handgun,
the full force of the law will fall down on him, and probably much harder than it would on most of us. 
After all, he's been warned." (chapter 5)
