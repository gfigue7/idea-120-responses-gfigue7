how you believe Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" is to be understood.
Discuss one example in depth of how aspects of tools you may use (such as Gmail, Instagram, TikTok, etc) are reflections of the designer's or developer's 'mental structure' and their own identity.

The work we do reflects on us. An example of this is in the game Bitlife, 
where you only have a couple of seconds to make decisions that will either extend your life or end it. 
That reflects how the developer feels about life and analyzes the people playing it. 

The stories we make and the way we see life have a lot to do with our upbringing; whether it is cultural or situational, our work reflects that. 
I had a friend who made a game where she would write a name of a mythological creature or land, and people would try to draw it. 
She was able to receive different results because people grew up listening to different renditions of these characters.
