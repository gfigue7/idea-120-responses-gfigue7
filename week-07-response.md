# James Bridle, Something is Wrong On the Internet


Bridle speaks on the damage the internet causes in children. 
 "What we’re talking about is very young children, effectively from birth, being deliberately targeted with content which will traumatise and disturb them,
via networks which are extremely vulnerable to exactly this form of abuse.
It’s not about trolls, but about a kind of violence inherent in the combination of digital systems and capitalist incentives.
It’s down to that level of the metal."(medium.com).
I never really thought about it before, but after reading the article and having the class discussion, I can see how these are placed in videos for kids.

I agree with what he says because the internet works only shows us what we want to see and damages our perspective on the world around us. 
Before I got an Ann Taylor, I had never heard or seen ads about it, and the people around me did not know about the retail store either.
Once I started working there is when I began to receive Ads. And another example is what we discussed in class about the 2016 election. 
The class found it shocking when Trump won, considering the news they received. 
But it shows show the internet will show you what you agree with.
